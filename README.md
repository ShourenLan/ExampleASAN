# ExampleASAN

This is a project that shows how to use ASan on a production Android device using wrap.sh.

The steps to getting this to work:
1.) install su on your android device
2.) use the same build.gradle as demo'd here.

NB.  This project does not need to use asan_device_setup.  Full explanation and details can be found on my blog. (coming soon).
